## Calculation of total CPUE
CPUE for each tow is calculated as the total catch (in kg) divided by the effort (area swept in km^2). The quick calculation for this from the RACEBASE tables is `effort = distance_fished * (0.001 * net_width)`. 

### Mean weighted CPUE
The weighted mean CPUE for each stratum is:
$$
\overline{CPUE}{_{ik}} = \frac{\sum{j=1}{n_i}}{}
$$


### Stratum biomass
Stratum biomass is estimated as  `area * mean_wgt_cpue / vulnerability * 0.001`
$$
\hat{B}_{ik} = (\frac{A_i}{0.01})^2 \cdot \overline{CPUE}{_{ik}}
$$

Mean CPUE is calculated for each stratum, then the total CPUE is the weighted sum of those across all strata, weighted by the total area of each stratum (equation 4 in Wakabayashi et al. 1985). The overall mean CPUE for the entire survey area is $\overline{CPUE}_{Tk}$:

$$
\overline{CPUE}_{Tk} = \frac{\sum_{i}{\overline{CPUE}_{ik}}\cdot A_i}{A_T}
$$

Where $k$ is the species, $i$ is the stratum, $A_i$ is the stratum area, and $A_T$ is the total survey area.
